            Header1: '1. Listen To Dive Briefing',
            Text1: 'Before each dive, a divemaster will give a briefing or overview of the dive conditions, what marine life you will see and the route you will take. At the end of the brief, ask questions if you have them, there are no lame questions! \n It’s better to get the answers to your questions so you are more prepared prior to the dive. Make sure that you are aware of the basic hand signals so that you can appropriately signal to the divemaster, your buddy and others. ',
            Header2: '2. Learn To Clear Your Ears',
            Text2: 'Clearing your ears or equalizing is when the pressure is released from the ears and sinuses as you move deeper. To check if the eustachian tubes in your ears are open prior to diving, swallow and listen for a “click” sound. That means they are open and you are ready to dive. If there is a descent line from the boat, hold onto it and slowly move down as you equalize feet first. When you start to feel pressure in the ears, pinch your nose closed and slowly blow. You should feel a release or pop in the ears. Then move down the line a bit more. If at any time the pressure gets intense, go back up the line a little bit and you will feel some relief. Never force it just to keep up with the group and signal to the divemaster if you have a problem. A few other tips that help is to swallow when pinching the nose, move the jaw side to side/ forward, look up and try to stay calm. Stay ahead of the pressure and potential discomfort by equalizing often as you descent. After a handful of dives, this will become second nature!',
            Header3: '3. Stay close to your dive buddy',
            Text3: 'One of the most important rules of diving at any stage is staying with a buddy. This is so important because in certain situations you are each other’s lifeline. Whilst learning to dive, it is especially important that you don’t stray from your instructor or dive buddy. You might get distracted by all the underwater beauty, but remember, your safety and the safety of the group is much more important than following a beautiful fish somewhere away from safety.',
            Header4: '4. Stay Hydrated',
            Text4: 'Wondering why it is so important to stay hydrated when you are in the ocean? Well, you might not realize it but you sweat in the water just like you do on land. You don’t see it because you are already wet but it is just as important to hydrate for scuba diving as it is for going on a hike. Drink plenty of water the day before and the morning of a dive so that you won’t go into the dive dehydrated. Although it should be obvious, don’t dive while under the influence of alcohol.',
            Header5: '5. Keep a Dive Log',
            Text5: 'When you are first starting out it is helpful to keep track of the amount of air you consume, what type of wetsuit you wore and how much weight you used on a dive. That way on the next dive when they ask you how much weight you need, etc… you will have a good estimate. Every dive is so unique with varying conditions, marine life, corals, and more that you will encounter. It is a good habit to write in your logbook all the different things you saw that made it stand out. That way it will make it easier to remember dives and reminisce!',

            Text1: "For many, wreck diving is the ultimate experience. D iving amid caves, tunnels, and shipwrecks is a popular activity in the Maldives. The ocean floor of this tropical diving paradise holds some of the most beautiful shipwrecks. Divers get to witness how marine ecosystems adapt to take over these lost artifacts and discover the sunken treasures beneath the ocean's surface. The following are some notable shipwreck diving spots:",
            Text2: "Shipwrecks can be seen on the North Malé Atoll. On the southwest side of Hulhulé, lies the Victory wreck, a sunken cargo ship. Angsana Ihuru's home reef also has it's own wreck  named the Rannamaari. This however, was a decommissioned sand-dredging ship that was deliberately submerged to facilitate wreck diving.",
            Text3: "The wreck off the coast of Keyodhoo on Vaavu Atoll is thought to be an Indonesian ship that drifted empty into the atoll empty a few years ago. This is one of the most popular and 'Instagram-worthy' spots to visit.",
            Text4: "'Kudhimaa Wreck' is a medium-sized steel wreck off the coast of Machafushi house reef. The wreck was intentionally sunk to provide a wreck for divers visiting the South Ari Atoll. There are schools of bat fish, puffer fish, and the usual large lionfish on and around it. It's packed with photographic opportunities.",
            Text5: "The Shipyard is one of Lhaviyani Atoll's most popular diving destinations. This site has two 40-year-old wrecks. One is upright, while the other is lying on its side around 30 meters beneath the surface. Large pelagics, nurse sharks, and grey reef sharks frequent the area, which is home to a variety of fish.  This is another must-visit spot to add to your list.",

            Text1: "The Maldives' unique underwater environment is what makes it such a fantastic location to scuba dive. When diving in the Maldives, you should know three native words: thila, giri, and kandu. These three words are local terminology for the underwater formation, and they can be helpful.",
            Header2: '1. Thila',
            Text2: "Thila is an underwater mountain that can be found at depths of eight meters or more. It's usually big enough to explore in a single dive and has a lot of coral. A thila can be discovered in an atoll or in the channel (kandu).",
            Header3: '2. Giri',
            Text3: "A giri is similar to a thila, except it is normally found close to the ocean's surface and is commonly exposed during low tides. A giri, in comparison to a thila, has fewer currents moving around and through it, making it ideal for beginner divers.",
            Header4: '3. Kandu',
            Text4: "Kandu are the channels between the atolls, islands, and reefs. They usually have powerful currents that attract larger fish, and they are popular for drift diving, which involves allowing yourself to be carried by the current. You can also learn other vocabulary like 'rah', which refers to a medium-sized island, and 'finolhu', which refers to a small island with sparse vegetation.",
